[janusz@localhost root]$ makeaurhelpers
Please contribute to developing the 'makeaurhelpers' command at https://github.com/TermuxArch/TermuxArch/issues and https://github.com/TermuxArch/TermuxArch/pulls in order to have a greater working assortment of AUR helpers like 'yay' that builds Arch Linux packages in just a few taps.  More information about Arch Linux AUR helpers is at this https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers link;  Waiting six seconds...
